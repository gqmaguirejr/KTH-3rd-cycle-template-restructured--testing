    <p>This is the artifact for the “PacketMill: Toward per-core 100-Gbps Networking” paper published at ASPLOS’21.</p>
<p>PacketMill is a system that optimizes the performance of network functions via holistic inter-stack optimizations. More specifically, PacketMill provides a new metadata management model, called X-Change, enabling the packet processing frameworks to provide their custom buffer to DPDK and fully bypass rte_mbuf. Additionally, PacketMill performs a set of source-code \& intermediate representation (IR) code optimizations.</p>
<p>Our paper’s artifact contains the source code, the experimental workflow, and additional information to (i) set upPacketMill \& its testbed, (ii) perform some of the experiments presented in the paper, and (iii) validates the reusability \& effectiveness of PacketMill.</p>
