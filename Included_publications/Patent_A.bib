   title = {Authenticatable graphical bar codes},
   abstract = {Systems and methods for generating and decoding authenticatable graphical bar codes are described. In one aspect, a corroborative signed message is generated from information to be encoded, and a base image is modulated with a graphical encoding of the signed message to produce a marked image. In another aspect, a signed message is extracted from a marked image based upon a comparison of the marked image and a base image. The extracted signed message is decoded to produce a decoded message. Information encoded in the marked image is extracted from the decoded message and authenticated.},
