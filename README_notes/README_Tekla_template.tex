\title{Notes on `Tekla''-template}

\warningExpl{\textbf{This document is a work in progress.}}

This document describes and contrasts the third-cycle version of the thesis
template I have developed for use at \gls{KTH} with that of the thesis
template ``KTH Doctoral Thesis Template'' at 
\url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/kth-doctoral-thesis-template/gtbtnpgjnbsn} referred to from \url{https://www.kth.se/en/student/studier/examensarbete/avhandlingarochexamensarbeten/mall-for-avhandling-1.458236}
[hereafter referred to as the Tekla-template].
My \LaTeX{} template overcomes many of what I view as deficiencies of the Tekla-template\footnote{Note that my referring to them as deficiencies is my own personal view of certain features (or lack thereof) of the Tekla-template and should \textbf{not} be taken as \textit{personal criticism of those who were involved in the creation of the Tekla-template}, but rather should be viewed as constructive criticism that hopefully can be used to improve the Tekla-template or other similar efforts.}.

\section{Good features of the Tekla-template}
The Tekla-template has a number of good features, these include (but are \textit{not} limited to):
\begin{itemize}[label=\color{green}\ding{51}]
\item The \fname{my-phd-thesis.tex} file is very simple and easy to understand. It
does have a front cover, title page, and book information page. While these will
later be typeset by the printing service, they are very useful for the
student, their supervisors, and others - especially to see that the degree, title, subtitle, and author's name are correct.

\item The \texttt{\textbackslash paper} macro is nice.

\item The inclusion of patents in addition to papers is nice.

\item The equation (4.1.2) nicely uses the modern notation: 
\texttt{\textbackslash symbf{A} \textbackslash symbfit{x} = \textbackslash
  symbfit{b}}

\item The requirement for the \texttt{mathtools} and \texttt{unicode-math} packages is good.

\item The example figures, table, and code listing are good.

\item The use of \texttt{\textbackslash Cref} for the table, equations, figures, and the listing is good.

\item The \fname{acronyms.tex} file includes a nice collection of acronyms and a glossary entry.

\item The \fname{macros.tex} file includes some nice examples of macros, including:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=latexExample, caption={Examples macros from macros.tex}, columns=fullflexible, showstringspaces=false, label=lst:examplemacro]
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\newcommand{\BigO}[1]{\(\mathcal{O}\left(#1\right)\)}
\newcommand{\di}{\mathrm{i}\mkern1mu} % imaginary i in roman and with correct spacing
\end{lstlisting}

\item The use of the \texttt{microtype} package is nice.

\item the use of the \texttt{lstfiracode} package and its subsequent use in \texttt{style=FiraCodeStyle} when defining the listing format for Python is very nice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deficiencies}

I believe that the Tekla-template has a number of deficiencies. These deficiencies include (but are \textit{not} limited to) the following:

\begin{itemize}[label=\color{red}\ding{56}]
  \item The Tekla-template fails to consider the entire process related to the thesis. For example, the student (or someone else) needs to enter the metadata into DiVA and the English and Swedish titles will need to be entered into LADOK.

  \item The Tekla-template lacks a back cover. [Note that this too will be generated by the printing service - so this is a \textit{minor} deficiency.]

  \item The Tekla-template does not seem to consider languages other than English and Swedish. Additionally, the support for Swedish is quite limited; for example, there is no information about a Swedish title or subtitle on the title page. Additionally, there is no configuration for the thesis being written in Swedish.

  \item The \texttt{\textbackslash defence} macro collects the relevant information but the \texttt{\textbackslash titlepage} macro does not have any support for a defense in Swedish.

  \item The Tekla-template has not parameterized the degree program or the degree - so the student may or may not correctly fill in this information.

  \item The title page lacks information about the supervisors.

  \item The book information page only seems to consider a traditional
    copyright and does not have any support for copyleft, such as Creative Commons licenses.

  \item The book information page does not seem to have any support to
    acknowledge the source of the optional cover illustration.

  \item The \texttt{dedication} environment sets the page \texttt{\textbackslash raggedleft} in italics.

  \item While the AW-template also places the ``List of included papers'' before the table of contents - as does the Tekla-template, I think it should be placed just before the start of the kappa part (if there is a kappa). Additionally, the page should have the title ``List of Publications'', since they are not necessarily all papers. Also, the capitalization is inconsistent with the capitalization of the other preface pages. Also, this page includes the paragraph:
    \begin{quote}
    \textbackslash paragraph\{Contributions\} This doctoral dissertation consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the research field on which I focused and a summary of my contributions to it. The second part comprises the contributions that I have made to this research field through published works and patent applications.
    \end{quote}

    However, this text is misleading in that it does not describe the author's contributions to the publication. Furthermore, this description should be in the body of the text and ideally follow a taxonomy such as \gls{CRediT}.

    Moreover, in the case of a compilation thesis, the first \texttt{part} is the kappa and the second \texttt{part} is the included publications. The kappa is \textbf{not} simply an overview of the research field.

  \item The mechanism for the included papers does not effectively utilize the BibTeX file (or even include citations to the publications).

  \item While the Tekla-template's inclusion of patents in addition to papers is nice; however, there is no support for other sorts of publications, such as software, datasets, and artifacts.

  \item The position of the ``Contents'' heading is not consistent with the other preface pages.

  \item I do not see why the preface pages should be listed in the table of contents.

  \item The table of contents lists the kappa and Appended papers with the capital Roman numeral numbering - but the pages themselves are not numbered!

  \item I do not think that the included papers should be in a \texttt{part} with the name ``Appended papers'' - as they are ``Included publications''.

  \item While the included chapters provide some style examples, Chapters 2 and 3 are missing text before the first section in each chapter, which I think is a poor example for students. Additionally, the chapters fail to provide useful guidance to the author for the content that would be expected in the chapters.

\item There is nothing in the template that explains what content would be in the chapter entitled ``Points of perspective''.

\item The chapters and sections should probably all have labels to facilitate cross-references in the document.

\item The table \texttt{tab:summary} might be a better example using \texttt{S[table-format=3.2]} rather than \texttt{r\@\{\}} for decimal aligning the prices.

\item The \fname{macros.tex} file is a mix of macros and \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage}, it might be better to separate these into two files.

\item In the definition of \fname{macros.tex} file, the definition for \textbackslash BigO when used with STIX Two Math would be \texttt{\textbackslash mathscr\{O\}} rather than \texttt{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}} - as the letter that is wanted is capital O in chancery Script (\ie \(\mathscr{O})\) and not a roundhand script (\ie \(\mathcal{O}\)). However, \texttt{unicode-math} already defines \texttt{\textbackslash mscrO} which generates \(\mscrO\), \ie the mathematical script capital O symbol, which is Unicode character U+1D4AA.

\item I would think that the tabbed page and the bibliographic information \& copyright/permission information could all be on one page; rather than as separate pages as done in the Tekla-template. Also, the tabs printed by \mbox{US-AB} are shorter.

\item The file \fname{includedpapers.tex} states ``\% This file defines the included papers in a kappa.''. However, it really only defines the tabbed page and the bibliographic information \& copyright/permission information page - it does not tell the student \textit{how to include the publications into the thesis} nor does the template provide a folder for these included publications. Moreover, the papers are \textbf{not} included \textit{in} the kappa, but rather are included together with the kappa in the (compilation) thesis.

  \item While \textbf{Fira Code} is nice for program listings, it is unclear to me why the mono-spaced font should be \textbf{Fira Code}. There are places other than program listings where a mono-spaced font would be suitable, and this font should probably be chosen to suit the font used for the body text [hence my use of TeXGyreCursor with TeXGyreTermes and TeXGyreHeros]. It is surprising that since \textbf{Fira Code} is known for its programming ligatures, the example chosen does not show this feature.

  \item \textbf{Fira Code} has 1585 glyphs, and one of these is a visible space, \ie Open Box “␣” (U+2423). The \texttt{lstinputlisting} of the Python example program uses \textbf{CMTT10} for this character.
  This can be fixed by adding the code in \Cref{lst:svisiblespace} to \fname{macros.tex}.
  \Needspace*{4\baselineskip}
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=latexExample, caption={Set the character used for a visible space in listings}, columns=fullflexible, showstringspaces=false, label=lst:svisiblespace]
\makeatletter
\def\lst@visiblespace{\texttt{^^^^2423}}
\makeatother
    \end{lstlisting}

\item In the definition of \texttt{\textbackslash lstset} for Python, you might set \texttt{tabsize=4}, as this is the number of spaces your \fname{example.py} used for the indent.

\item While the use of the microtype package is nice, one might add the \texttt{babel=true} option to the second \texttt{\textbackslash microtypesetup}. Note also that the \texttt{babel} package must be loaded before the \texttt{microtype} package when using the babel option.

\item When you specify the cleveref form for an equation in \Cref{lst:eqcref}, you might add a comment that you are going to use a parenthesized equation number to refer to the equation from your text; therefore, there are no singular or plural cross-reference names.
Additionally, you might promote the use of descriptive label names, for example \texttt{eq:integralAsLimitoFSum} instead of \texttt{eq:three}.
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=latexExample, caption={Configuring cleveref for equations}, columns=fullflexible, showstringspaces=false, label=lst:eqcref]
\crefname{equation}{}{}
\Crefname{equation}{}{}
  \end{lstlisting}

\item In your examples of equations, you might note that there is a subtle issue about when equations should be numbered and when not, \ie if they are not referred to from elsewhere, then they should not be numbered. This can be done automatically with the \texttt{mathtools} package with
\texttt{\textbackslash mathtoolsset\{showonlyrefs\}}. Note that this will \textbf{only} work if you use \texttt{\textbackslash eqref} to reference your equations\footnote{There is also a bug when using the ntheorem package if the option thmmarks is active. See the mathtools manual for details and solutions.}. The cleveref manual states: ``Cleveref is currently incompatible with the mathtools package’s showonlyrefs option, which automatically labels only those equations that are cross-referenced. The autonum package provides a possible alternative, which implements similar features in a cleveref-compatible manner.''.


  \item While the glossary entry for ``PhD'' is humorous, it is a bit misleading and perhaps not helpful to your readers. There are only a very small fraction (113/7292 = 1.5 \%) of theses that are 300 or more pages (including preface pages); in fact, the CDF of total pages at 300 pages are approximately:
  ABE:	0.9793,
CBH:	0.9972,
EECS:	0.9939,
ITM:	0.9905, and
SCI:	0.9916. Looking at the CDF of total pages, the first bin (using a bin size of 10) of lengths exceeding 0.90 occurs at: ABE: 120, CBH: 90, EECS: 110, ITM: 110, and SCI: 100 pages.


\item The Tekla-template does not include the keywords in the document's properties.

\item The Tekla-template does not include the copyright information in the additional metadata.

\item In setting fontsize, for example, when setting the fontsize for a section in \Cref{lst:sectionHeadingFont}, 
it might be better to use \texttt{\textbackslash fontsize\{14\}\{16\}\textbackslash fontseries\{sb\}} to set \texttt{\textbackslash baselineskip} to be larger than the font size of the text and to select the semibold version of the glyphs. The AW-template specified that the font size for a section was 14pt.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=latexExample, caption={Setting font for section hadings}, columns=fullflexible, showstringspaces=false, label=lst:sectionHeadingFont]
\titleformat{\section}
  {\sffamily\fontsize{13pt}{13pt}\selectfont\bfseries} % Figtree Semibold, 13pt
  {\thesection}{1em}{}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \textbf{LMSans17-Regular} is one of the embedded fonts, and it uses a custom coding (note that it appears twice). This font is used in \texttt{example-image-a} and \texttt{example-image-b} images provided by the \texttt{mwe} package. \textbf{CMTT10} is another embedded font. \textbf{CMTT10} is used for the visible space in the code listing. [See \Cref{lst:svisiblespace} for how to avoid the use of \textbf{CMTT10}.]

\item While the requirement for the \texttt{mathtools} and
  \texttt{unicode-math} packages were good, it is unclear to me why the mathfont used is \fname{latinmodern-math.otf} rather than a more complete font such as \textbf{STIX Two Math}:
  latinmodern-math has 2045 glyphs versus STIX Two Math with 4605 glyphs. For the list of characters present in one, but not the other see \Cref{tab:missing_from_STIXTwoMath,tab:missing_from_latinmodern_math}. Note that some of the glyphs in STIX Two Math make use of the Private Use Area, U+E000 - U+F8FF; specifically, U+E000 to  U+E3FF. These unicode values \textbf{cannot} be interpreted without the knowledge that the font being used was STIX Two Math. This means that these characters \textbf{cannot} be used in DiVA and LADOK.
